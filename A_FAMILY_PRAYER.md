# A Family Prayer
Give us new eyes, Lord, to see our lives
in the light of your love.
Too often our fear, neediness, anger,
or hurt fogs our vision.
Help us to see your providence in the glory of trees, lakes, and cloudless skies.
Help us to see your generosity in the many gifts we enjoy each day.
Help us to see your wisdom in the rhythm of the days, the weeks, the seasons, and the years.
Help us to see your image in the faces of everyone we meet and to know
your goodness in the joy and love
we feel for one another.
We ask you this because we know you love us. Amen.
