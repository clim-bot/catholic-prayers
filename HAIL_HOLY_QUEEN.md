# hail, Holy Queen

Hail, holy Queen, Mother of mercy, hail, our life, our sweetness, and our hope.
To you we cry, the children of Eve; to you we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping
in the land of exile. Turn, then most gracious advocate, your eyes of merch towards us;
lead us home at last and show unto us the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus: O clement,
O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
