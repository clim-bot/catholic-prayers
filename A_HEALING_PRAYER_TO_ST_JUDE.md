# A Healing Prayer to St. Jude
Most holy Apostle, St. Jude, friend of Jesus,
I place myself in your care at this difficult
time. Pray for mel help me know that I need
not face my troubles alone. Please join me in 
my need, asking God to send me consolation in my
sorrow, courage in my fear, and healing in the midst of my suffering. Ask
our loving God to fill me with the grace to
accept whatever may lie ahead for me and my loved ones, and to strengthen my faith in God's healing power. Thank you, St. Jude, for the promise of hope you hold out to all
who believe. Inspire me to give this gift of hope to others as it has been given to me.
Amen.
