# Prayer to the Holy Spriti
Come, Holy Sprit, fill the hearts of yoru faithful. And kindle in them the fire of your love.
Senf forth your Spirit and they shall be created. And you will renew the face of the earth.

Lord, by the light of the Holy Spririt you have taught the hearts of your faithful. In the same spirit help us to relish what is right and always rejoice in your consolation. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.
