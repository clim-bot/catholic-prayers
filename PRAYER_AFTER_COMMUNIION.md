# Prayer after Communion (St. Ignatius of Loyola)
Dearest Lord,
teach me to be generous.
Teach me to serve you as you deserve;
to give and not to count the cost;
to fight, and not to heed the wounds;
to labor, and not to seek to rest;
to give of myself and not to ask for reward,
expect the reward of knowing that I am
doing your will. Amen
