# St. Jude Prayer in the Morning
St. Jude, giver of hope, let the promise of this new day fill my heart with the light of hope, and keep it lit with the love of God. Bless me in my work today. Help
me to forgive readily and to know and do God's holy and true will. May everything
that I am bring glory to God, and lead me closer to Him. Amen.
