# Prayer to the Holy Spirit
Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful. And kindle in them the fire of your love.
Sent forth your Spirit, and they shall be created. And you will renew the face of the earth.

Lord, by the light of the Holy Spirit, you have taught the hearts of your faithful. In the same spirit help us to relish what is right and always rejoice in your consolation. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.
