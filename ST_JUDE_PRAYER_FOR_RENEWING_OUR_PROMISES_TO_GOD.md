# St. Jude Prayer for Renewing our Promises to God
St. Jude, your hope is a pathway to God's peace. May my faith journey continually
affirm the promises made when I was young to keep Christ at the center of my life. With
Christ, I pray for the spiritual strength to overcome the challenges I encounter, and to include His guidance in all of my choices. With you, St. Jude, I seek hope in God's promise to me for unconditional love, compassion, and eternal life. Amen.
