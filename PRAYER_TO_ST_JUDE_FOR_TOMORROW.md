# Prayer to St. Jude for Tomorrow
St. Jude, may your path of hope be mine in the days ahead. I promise in faith
to share your hope with others, to forgive as I am forgiven by my Father in heaven,
and to show caring and kindness at every opportunity. Guide me, St. Jude, so that I begin each new day with gratitude, truth, and hope in my heart. Challenge me, St. Jude, to end each day reflecting on my actions and motivations so that I grow in faith, love, and hope. Amen
