# THE ROSARY
The rosary is a devotion in honof of the Virgin Mary. You will be gin on the crucifix with the Sign of the Cross and the Apostles Creed. Say an Our Dather on the large bead and one Hail Mary for each of the next three smaller beads. On the next large bead, say a Glory Be to the Father, announce and meditate on the first mystery and say an Our Father. Say a Hail Mary for each of the following smaller beads, and end the decade with Glory Be. Begin a new cycle with an Our Father, meditate on the second mystery, and use the same process for the rest of the mystery.
