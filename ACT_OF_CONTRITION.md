# Act of Contrition
O, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended you. I detest all my sins because
of your just punishment, but most of all because they offended you, my God, who are
all-good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of your grace,
to sin no more and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen
